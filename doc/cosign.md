## Docker image signing and verification <a href="#cosign" id="cosign"></a>

Docker images that are part of the TRUE Connector are signed using [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). In releases section, you can find appropriate version of cosign executable, appropriate of the target OS.

Signed images starts with following versions:

**rdlabengpa/ids\_execution\_core\_container:v1.14.4**\

**rdlabengpa/ids\_be\_data\_app:v0.3.3**\

**rdlabengpa/ids\_uc\_data\_app\_platoon:v1.7.5**\

**rdlabengpa/ids\_uc\_data\_app\_platoon\_pip:v1.0.0**\


Once images are downloaded, you can verify the signature by executing following command, (trueconn.pub file can be found in the root of this repo) and response should be like following

```
cosign verify --key trueconn.pub rdlabengpa/ids_execution_core_container:v1.14.4

Verification for index.docker.io/rdlabengpa/ids_execution_core_container:v1.14.4 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - The signatures were verified against the specified public key
