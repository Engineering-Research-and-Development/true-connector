# Security policies

The TRUE Connector uses state-of-the-art TLS 1.3 encryption for https/wss communication which is also implemented and used for idscp2 communication. In addition to TLS 1.3, security is also bolstered by using DAPS for identity provisioning and management based on the newest X.509v3 standard of certificates.
