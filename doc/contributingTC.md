# Contributing TRUE Connector

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the TRUE Connector. Contributing is based on [GitHub guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for contributing to a project. You are very
welcome to contribute to this project.

## Changelog

We document changes in the CHANGELOG.md on root level in each project.

## Issues

You always have to create an issue if you want to integrate a bugfix, improvement, or feature. Briefly and clearly describe the purpose of your contribution in the corresponding issue. You can send email to the [TRUE Connector team](mailto:trueconnector-team@eng.it) before creating an issue, if unclear in which project to create an issue.

**Bug Report**: As mentioned above, bug reports should be submitted as an issue. To give others
the chance to reproduce the error in order to find a solution as quickly as possible, the report
should at least include the following information:
* Description: What did you expect and what happened instead?
* Steps to reproduce (system specs included)
* Relevant logs and/or media (optional): e.g. an image
